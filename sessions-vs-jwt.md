### **The Problem: "How to Remember a User?"**
Imagine a website is like a coffee shop. When you walk in, the barista has no idea who you are. You have to introduce yourself each time you place an order. This can get annoying if you’re ordering multiple times!

For websites, the "barista" is the server, and it needs a way to remember you after you log in. That's where **Sessions** and **JWTs** come into play. They're like two different ways to help the server know who you are without making you reintroduce yourself every time you interact.

### **1. Sessions: A Sticky Note Behind the Counter**
- **How it works:** 
  When you log in, the server writes your name (or an ID) on a sticky note and sticks it behind the counter. Every time you order (visit a page), you hand over a "membership card" (a **session ID** stored in your browser). The server checks the sticky note and says, "Oh, it’s you! I know you because your session ID matches this sticky note."

- **What’s stored?**
  The sticky note (on the server) contains all the information about you—your name, order history, etc.

- **Pros:**
  - Very secure since all the info is stored safely behind the counter (on the server).
  - The server has full control. If you leave the coffee shop (log out), the barista can tear up the sticky note.

- **Cons:**
  - If a lot of people visit the coffee shop, the counter gets cluttered with sticky notes (memory usage on the server).
  - Not ideal if you have multiple branches (servers) since each branch has to share or synchronize sticky notes.

### **2. JWT: A Self-Contained Badge**
- **How it works:**
  Instead of leaving a sticky note behind the counter, the barista gives you a badge (a JWT). The badge has your name, membership level, and even your coffee preferences **written on it**. It’s signed with a secret stamp that the barista can verify. Every time you order, you just show your badge, and the barista says, "Yep, this is legit!" without needing to check a sticky note.

- **What’s stored?**
  The badge itself contains all the information about you. The server doesn’t store anything—it just checks the badge.

- **Pros:**
  - No cluttered counter (the server doesn’t have to store anything).
  - Works well across multiple branches (servers), as the badge works everywhere.

- **Cons:**
  - If someone steals your badge, they can pretend to be you until it expires.
  - The barista can’t revoke your badge before it expires unless they keep a list of invalid badges (defeating the purpose of no storage).

### **Quick Comparison Table**

| Feature                 | Sessions (Sticky Note)           | JWT (Self-Contained Badge)   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Where info is stored** | On the server                    | Inside the token (client-side) |
| **Security**            | Secure but uses server memory    | Less secure if stolen, no instant revocation |
| **Scalability**         | Can get heavy on large systems   | Lightweight, good for distributed systems |
| **Revoking access**     | Easy (just tear up the note)     | Hard unless using extra tools |
| **Use case**            | Best for smaller, centralized apps | Best for APIs, distributed apps |

### **In Layman Terms**
- **Sessions** are like the barista keeping a note for you behind the counter. It’s easy to manage and secure, but the shop has to handle all those notes.
- **JWT** is like carrying a badge that proves who you are. It’s fast and portable, but if someone steals your badge, you’re in trouble until the badge expires.

Each method has its pros and cons, and the choice depends on the coffee shop (website) and its needs!
